This repository contains a small project. We have a ton of books at home and I wanted to make an inventory of them.

Firstly, I scanned every ISBN code of the books with my phone. Then export the codes to a spreadsheet.

Then from that spreadsheet with the use of http://www.mokka.hu/ (Hungarian Book Catalogue), 
I wrote a script to automate the mining of some of the data about the books: 
the author, the title, the year of release, press office etc.
